1. Format the code -- always!
2. Give the first form a better filename (index.html or index.php).  Does it matter?
3. Make sure that, as an end-user, you can navigate from start to finish.
4. Process the form data so that all of the input is displayed on the final page.
5. Make sure that the user cannot start the app somewhere in the middle by redirecting their browser to the start (HINT: if they go to the last page right away, what would the SESSION look like?).
6. Do whatever you can to make your web app easy to use (i.e., grade).  Thanks!
